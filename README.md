## Abstract

Several cities in the United States are experiencing a homelessness crisis, with San Francisco often cited due to its high housing prices and limited housing supply. Our project aims to examine the relationship between the count of unsheltered persons and housing prices in San Francisco from 2020 to 2024 at the census tract level. Specifically, we aim to compare monthly estimates of unsheltered individuals with average monthly rent, both of which require interpolation and estimation to obtain sufficiently granular, temporal data.

Building on the city’s publicly available encampment location data, we will use statistical methods to integrate quarterly structure-based counts with monthly aggregates of homelessness-related 311 service requests and eviction rates to generate tract-level monthly estimates of unsheltered homelessness. To obtain monthly rental price estimates, we plan to use ACS 5-year average rent data to establish baseline neighborhood rent levels and combine them with monthly Zillow Observed Rent Index data at the ZIP code level.

Overall, our project will have a strong focus on spatial analysis and mapping, visualizing key homelessness-related metrics across tracts for selected time periods through a heatmap, as well as the relationship between encampments, rent prices, and demographics across tracts.
