## Abstract
Several cities in the United States are experiencing a homelessness crisis, with San Francisco often cited due to its high housing prices and limited housing supply. Our project examines tract-level homelessness and housing indicators in San Francisco from 2020 to 2024. We aligned multiple datasets onto the same spatial-temporal scale, aggregating and interpolating point-level data (quarterly encampment counts, daily 311 calls, and daily eviction reports) to census tracts by month. We also disaggregated monthly ZIP code-level median rent data to census tracts by weighting with HUD crosswalks and normalizing with ACS baseline values.

Using multipliers from the literature applied to encampment counts, we generated tract-level estimates of the street homeless population. These estimates and metrics were integrated into an interactive dashboard featuring: (1) a heatmap showing metrics by tract and month; (2) scatterplots of street homelessness and the distribution of tents, structures, and vehicles for a selected census tract; (3) a scatterplot of monthly median rent that updates by ZIP code; and (4) a regression analysis linking 311 calls to tract-level characteristics.

Overall, our dashboard highlights spatial and temporal patterns in homelessness and housing, helping policymakers and community organizations better target interventions, allocate resources, and make informed housing policy decisions.

## Instructions to run our project 
1. Clone our repository by running `git clone git@github.com:uchicago-2026-capp30122/project-all-access-livable-housing.git` in your terminal.
2. After cloning the repository, run `uv sync` in the project root directory to install the required packages and set up the virtual environment.
3. *[Optional -- these files should already be included in the repository]* To retrieve API data and regenerate the clean data files, run `uv run python -m src --data` in the root directory. This will take around 3 minutes to run.
4. To launch our interactive dashboard and visualizations, run `uv run python -m src --dashboard` in the root directory.
5. Copy the Dash URL printed in the terminal and paste it into your web browser to view the dashboard.
